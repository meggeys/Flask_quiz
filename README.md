# Flask_quiz
A simple quiz created with Flask with free answers but self-check on points

## Functions
This is a simple quiz created with Flask.

In this quiz, people can submit their own answers but have to select themselves whether or not they answered the questions correctly.

After an answer is submitted, the answer of the user as well as the correct answer are printed. Additionally, the question whether or not they answered the question correctly is printed, where "yes" and "no" can be selected.

## Limitations
The questions are hard-coded into index.html and for every question, the "show_answer" function in quiz.py needs to be updated.

The answers can also be hard-coded into index.html instead of coding them into the "show_answer" function in quiz.py.
